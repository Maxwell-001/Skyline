# CSS Skyline
Welcome to my CSS Skyline project! This project is a fun exploration of CSS variables and their usage in creating a simple skyline scene using only HTML and CSS. It's a beginner-friendly project that allowed me to experiment with CSS variables and practice my skills in web development.

## Features:
#### HTML and CSS: 
The entire skyline scene is created using only HTML elements and CSS styles. No JavaScript or external libraries were used.
#### CSS Variables: 
I've utilized CSS variables to control various aspects of the skyline, such as building height, color, and positioning.
#### Creative Design: 
While I'm still learning, I've attempted to create an aesthetically pleasing skyline with buildings of different heights and colors to simulate a cityscape.
#### Learning Opportunity: 
Through building this project, I've gained hands-on experience with CSS variables, layout, and styling techniques.
## Usage:

#### Open in Browser: 
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the CSS skyline.

#### Explore: 
Take a look at the skyline scene and observe how the CSS variables affect the appearance of the buildings and the overall layout.

#### Experiment: 
Feel free to experiment with the CSS variables by modifying their values in the CSS file and observing the changes in the skyline and day and night color mode when you at the min and max width.

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas for enhancing the skyline design, or if you spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
